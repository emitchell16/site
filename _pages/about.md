I am a researcher pursuing my PhD in Health Services Research and Health Policy with a concentration in Health Economics at Emory University in the Rollins School of Public Health. 

I am interested in the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs and other medical products, particularly in Medicare. My current research focus is access to high-cost glucose-lowering drugs. 

I previously worked with the Duke University Margolis Center for Health Policy with a focus on coverage, payment, and competition issues around high-cost biologic drugs and cell and gene therapies. I received my bachelor's degree in Economics and Philosophy from Swarthmore College.
